Project is completed in following tasks:

Introduction
Importing Covid19 dataset
Finding a good Measure
Importing and preparing World happiness report dataset
Merge two datasets and find correlations among your data
Visualize your results using Seaborn


In this project :
I have used 

1)Seaborn tool for Ploting : Scatter graph and log(y) as the graph didnot had scattering effect as values on y axis were very less.using log(y) the values of y were maximised.

2)We have calculated maxima for each country using diiferentiation(diff()) and scraped the data sets.

3)Then merged the data sets and calculated correlation using correlation matrix.

4)Simply plotted the correlation of 1 factor vs the maximum infected rate.
